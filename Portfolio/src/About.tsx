          <p>
            I am a passionate Software Engineer with a love for frontend
            development and creating intuitive, user-friendly applications.
            Through self-study and dedication, I immersed myself in learning
            JavaScript and was accepted into an advanced, full-time open-source
            tech immersive program. During the program, I contributed to an
            open-source project alongside a team of talented developers, working
            directly with the maintainer of the Jotai state management dev tool
            to update features and enhance the UI. As an Eagle Scout, I bring a
            unique perspective to my work, with a deep sense of curiosity and a
            desire to explore and understand the world around me. My ultimate
            goal is to make meaningful contributions to a team and continuously
            grow as an individual while deepening my understanding of the inner
            workings of technology.
